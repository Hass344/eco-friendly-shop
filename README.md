Each order form is designed to post directly to our order processing script (processorder.php), ensuring a smooth transaction.

Key Features: The page includes a user-friendly contact form where customers can enter their name, email, and message. Once submitted, the form data is sent to processcontact.php, allowing us to respond promptly to inquiries.
Order Processing (processorder.php)
Purpose: This script plays a crucial role in our online shop by handling all order submissions. It ensures that we receive the necessary details from customers so we can process their requests efficiently.
Key Features: Upon submission of an order form, this script captures the product and quantity information. It then generates a confirmation message that is displayed back to the user, reassuring them that their order has been received and will be processed.
Code Adaptations
Form Handling: I adapted PHP code from my course materials to handle both order submissions and contact form messages. This allowed me to create a seamless user experience while ensuring that all data is processed correctly.
HTML Structure: The HTML structure was built on the templates provided in my coursework, spanning Chapters 1-7. This approach helped maintain a consistent layout and design throughout all pages, making it easier for users to navigate.
Challenges Faced
Form Validation: One of the main challenges was ensuring that all forms were properly validated before submission. I wanted to enhance user experience by preventing any incomplete or incorrect submissions. Implementing validation checks required some trial and error, but it ultimately made the forms more robust and user-friendly.
Styling Consistency: Another challenge was achieving a cohesive design across multiple pages. I spent a good amount of time refining the CSS to ensure that colors, fonts, and layouts matched throughout the site. This attention to detail was important in creating a polished and professional look that enhances usability.
